# Built a twitter clone using HTML, CSS and javascript (no frameworks). It is based on real twitter where the user can tweet, interact with other's tweet (those tweets that are stored in the data array) and also interact with his own tweets. The user can like, reply and retweet a previously made tweet and upon doing so, the color of the icon changes that shows that the user has interacted with the tweet.
